This is a Midterm Project for Intro to Game Development, completed over the course of 3 months.

I took the concept from my Health-Bar project (draining health bar that is slowly recovered by mashing the space bar) with
a scene from the game, The Beginner's Guide (speficially the cleaning the house scene).

Features include:
- First Person Walking in a 3D environment
- Custom Dialog Boxes
- Minigame where a Cleaning Progress bar is constantly decreasing, and needs to be increased by continously mashing Space Bar
